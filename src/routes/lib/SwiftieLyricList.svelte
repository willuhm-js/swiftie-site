Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\n\nSo this is me swallowin' my pride\nStandin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\n\nThese days, I haven't been sleepin'\nStayin' up playin' back myself leavin'\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nThen I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughin' from the passenger's side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\nWhen fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n\nSo this is me swallowin' my pride\nStandin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinkin'\nProbably mindless dreamin'\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\n\nBut this is me swallowin' my pride\nStandin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you\nWishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nAll the time",

Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust mе\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n\n\nBеtty, I know where it all went wrong\nYour favorite song was playing\nFrom the far side of the gym\nI was nowhere to be found\nI hate the crowds, you know that\nPlus, I saw you dance with him\n\n\nYou heard the rumors from Inez\nYou can't believe a word she says\nMost times, but this time it was true\nThe worst thing that I ever did\nWas what I did to you\n\n\nBut if I just showed up at your party\nWould you have me? Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust me\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n\nI was walking home on broken cobblestones\nJust thinking of you when she pulled up like\nA figment of my worst intentions\nShe said \"James, get in, let's drive\"\nThose days turned into nights\nSlept next to her, but\nI dreamt of you all summer long\n\n\nBetty, I'm here on your doorstep\nAnd I planned it out for weeks now\nBut it's finally sinkin' in\nBetty, right now is the last time\nI can dream about what happens when\nYou see my face again\n\n\nThe only thing I wanna do\nIs make it up to you\nSo I showed up at your party\nYeah, I showed up at your party\n\n\nYeah, I showed up at your party\nWill you have me? Will you love me?\nWill you kiss me on the porch\nIn front of all your stupid friends?\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissin' in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight\nYou know I miss you",

Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\nLooking at it now\nLast December (Last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nThen fall back together (Back together)\nOoh, your necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided, we decided\nTo move the furniture so we could dance\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinking\n\n\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in the hospital room\nWhen you started crying, baby, I did too\nBut when the sun came up, I was looking at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat?\nI walked out, I said, \"I'm setting you free\"\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nWhen the sun came up, you were looking at me\nYou were looking at me, ooh\nYou were looking at me\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)\nI remember\n(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

(You could be GLAAD)\nSunshine on the street at the parade\nBut you would rather be in the dark ages\nMakin' that sign must've taken all night\n\n\nYou just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace\nAnd control your urges to scream about all the people you hate\n'Cause shade never made anybody less gay\n\n\nSo oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down, you're being too loud\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?\nYou need to calm down\n\nAnd we see you over there on the internet\nComparing all the girls who are killing it\nBut we figured you out\nWe all know now we all got crowns\nYou need to calm down\n\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nYou need to calm down (You need to calm down)\nYou're being too loud (You're being too loud)\nAnd I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\nYou need to just stop (Can you stop?)\nLike can you just not step on our gowns?\nYou need to calm down",
